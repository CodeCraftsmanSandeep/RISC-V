## Introduction to RISC-V architecture:
RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) designed for computer processors. It stands for "Reduced Instruction Set Computer - Five." The RISC-V architecture is based on the concept of reduced instruction set computing, which emphasizes simplicity and efficiency by using a smaller set of instructions.
More specifically, RISC-V has been used in cloud computing, servers, and embedded applications.

### Guiding Design principles in RISC-V ISA:
1) Simplicity favours regularity.
2) Smaller is faster.
3) Good design demands good compromises.

## Pipelining:

### What is pipelining?
Pipelining is a technique where multiple sub-tasks of instructions are implemented at the same time. Pipelining allows mutiple sub‐tasks to be carried out simultaneously using independent resources(Instruction level parallelism) <br/>

Let us consider a real life example of manufacturing a car, let the steps require to build a car be: <br/>
![pic5](https://github.com/112101011/5-stage-RISC-V-pipeline./assets/111628378/24763001-d402-4bed-8255-db61b8a09475)
let each sub-task takes 20 minutes. <br/>

Suppose at each time unit, only one sub-task can be performed then: <br/>


![pic3](https://github.com/112101011/5-stage-RISC-V-pipeline./assets/111628378/cda13893-9402-4668-bc74-d8107a5354fa)
Suppose pipelining is allowed then: <br/>
![pic4](https://github.com/112101011/5-stage-RISC-V-pipeline./assets/111628378/a99cff10-592f-4896-a902-e6e63fb4d924)

From the above pictures we can clearly see the advantage of pipelining in using the resources effeciently and thereby consuming less time. <br/>

###  5-stages for implementing instruction(in general):
Similar to MIPS architecture there are 5 stages in RISC-V ISA(Instruction Set Architecture) :
1) IF : Instruction fetch from Instruction cache.
2) ID : Instruction Decode and Register read.
3) EX: Execute Operations[eg: add, sub] (or) Calculate address[ld, sd].
4) MEM: Access memory operands from data cache.
5) WB: Write result back to the register in register file.

### Why pipelining in computer architecture?

Execution time = IC * CPI * T <br/>
IC – Instruction count
CPI – Cycles Per Instruction
T – Clock Period.

In a single cycle processing unit the instructions are going to be executed sequentially one by one. Here CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) is low [for one instruction – one cycle] but here we are going to have a long clock period [the clock period corresponds to slowest instruction]. As a result the execution time is going to increase significantly due to long clock period, which results in less performance. This single cycle processing unit doesn’t have any benefit except its simplicity.

Picture title: Diagram representing single cycle processing unit: <br/>
![pic1](https://github.com/112101011/5-stage-RISC-V-pipeline./assets/111628378/39e8201e-d7c7-4a26-a98d-416471c1e3ad)


CPI (Cycles Per Instruction): 1 <br/>
Clock period: IF_time + ID_time + EX_time + MEM_time + WB_time
		    (long clock period, critical path: ld instruction) 

In a multi-cycle processing unit each stage is executed in one cycle without pipelining. This results high CPI[one instruction 5 stages – 5 cycles] and short clock period [clock period corresponding to the longest time taken among 5 stages]. As a result execution time is going to increase and due to which performance decreases. Here one important thing to note that at each cycle, all hardware except the hardware corresponding to the stage executed in that cycle remains idle (unused). <br/>

CPI : 5 <br/>
Clock period:  max{IF_time, ID_time, EX_time, MEM_time,  WB_time}

### Challenges for pipelining

1) Speed up issues when unbalanced.
   If the time taken by all stages is same (that is balanced) then we can say that (𝑡ⅈ𝑚ⅇ)_𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑 =  (𝑡ⅈ𝑚ⅇ)_(𝑛𝑜𝑛−𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑)/(Number of stages) <br/>
   But in general the stages are not balanced, so we do not get the ideal speed up as written in the above formulae. The throughput will be less than expected. But the throughput of pipelined datapath will be far better than non-pipelined datapath. <br/>
   Eg: if the time needed for ID stage is less than EX stage, when these both stages are executing in the same clock cycle, ID stage should wait for getting next computation until the EX stage gets completed. <br/>
   Figure : ID , WB stages take less time(register operations) than other stages: <br/>
   ![screen](https://github.com/112101011/5-stage-RISC-V-pipeline./assets/111628378/9a33059e-ee2b-4042-a3b6-b0d8973c4141)

2) Hazards: <br/>
   a) Structural Hazards <br/>
      Conflict for use of resource, IF and MEM stage requires memory or cache element but if there is only one cache then a requirement of bubble is happening, so this can be avoided by giving two different caches Instruction-cache and Data-cache. <br/>
   b) Data Hazards <br/>
   An instruction depends on completion of previous instruction, this type of issue is known as Data dependencies. <br/>
   Eg: <br>
   	I1: addi x9, x10, 2 <br/>
    	I2: addi x11, x9, x4 <br/>
    	I2 depeneds on I1 because this is Write after read dependency  <br/>

 	Figure : Bubbles needed (no forwarding) due to data dependency: <br/>
   	![pic 20](https://github.com/112101011/5-stage-RISC-V-pipeline./assets/111628378/3aac46e5-9446-46ec-8e28-f27f7efd3fd0)
   	In the above case, WB is done in the first half of cycle and then ID. <br/>
   
    	Figure : Forwarding (aka bypassing) the above data dependency: <br/>
	![pic 21](https://github.com/112101011/5-stage-RISC-V-pipeline./assets/111628378/92ba5672-2de6-4cb8-a23f-8a8cd6ec8c37)

   	Not all data dependencies can be avoided by forwarding, if the instruction is ld instruction and next instruction is reading the register then there is a need of one bubble even when there is forwarding.

   c) Control Hazards.
   
   When a instruction is branch instruction the next instruction depends on the result of branch instruction.<br/>
   So there are many methods for overcoming this some of them are <br/>
   1) Computing branch at the ID stage (this needs one bubble).
   2) branch predictors ( dynamic and static branch predictors). <br/>
   Handling control hazards is out of the scope of this project.

## Goal:
Use hardware lying as much as possible.(running instructions in parallel though there is no actual parallel hardware)
1) Minimize the number of stalls
2) Thereby increasing the performance.
3) Retaining the simplicity of the hardware.

## Datapath:

### Features of this data path:

Our main motive of this project is to come close as much as possible to the actual RISC-V pipelined data path. The following features are included in this data path:
1) Pipelined data path: which allows multiple subtasks to be carried out simultaneously  using independent resources.
2) Important components of Data path: <br/>
   a) 20 32-bit instruction cache. (can be increased based on requirements) <br/>
   b) Program Counter. <br/>
   c) Instruction decoder. (R-type, I-type, S-type) <br/>
   d) 32 64-bit register file. <br/>
   e) Immediate Generator. <br/>
   f) 64-bit ALU(addition, subtraction, multiplication) <br/>
   g) 20 64-bit Data cache. (can be increase based on requirements) <br/>
   h) Pipeline registers(IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/MEM, MEM/WB) <br/>
   i) Control Unit. (Generate control signals) <br/>
   j) Forwarding unit. <br/>

![pic6](https://github.com/112101011/5-stage-RISC-V-pipeline./assets/111628378/8961486e-6f1c-4cd8-9818-44850725064e)
Note: Red wires depict the input and output of forwarding logic. The number in orange color boxes depict the number of bits. 

### Instruction cache and data cache:

### Register file:
There are 32 64-bit registes in register file of RISC-V architecture.

|registers| purpose |
|---------|---------|
X0|The constant value 0
X1 | return address
X2 | stack pointer
X3 | global pointer
X4 | thread pointer
X5 - X7, X28 - X31 | temporaries
X8 | frame pointer
X9, X18 - X27 | saved registers
X10 - X11 | function arguments/results
X12 - X17 | function arguments

### Role of immediate generator:
![pic8](https://github.com/112101011/5-stage-RISC-V-pipeline./assets/111628378/b7e53f0f-bb85-441d-a6b5-cac13caf92f4) <br/>
This imm generator performs sign extension of 12-bit immediate to 64-bit immediate. The reason for extension is that other registers in register file are 64-bit and the ALU is designed for 64-bits. 

### Role of 64-bit ALU:
In the data path designed here the ALU is designed for 64-bits and it performs addition and subtraction by carry look ahead adder logic and multiplication by booth’s algorithm. It gives one output of 64-bits size. <br/>
![pic7](https://github.com/112101011/5-stage-RISC-V-pipeline./assets/111628378/c68262dc-7ae2-431e-9220-76ceca6e3cb4)

## Forwarding unit
The forwarding unit is represented by the below block diagram but this forwarding unit can be viewed as several multiplexers placing together. The multiplexers involved  in this forwarding logic can be seen from verilog code. 
<br/>
![forwarding](https://github.com/112101011/5-stage-RISC-V-pipeline./assets/111628378/9e76bd33-cd4e-44ec-a875-339fab0c1641) <br/>

Forwarding unit is added in this data path to decrease the number of stalls and there by decreasing CPI and increasing performance of the processing unit.
The forwarding unit decides the operands to be sent to the ALU. The below conditions make sure that the most recent value is forwarded. The most recent value to forward will be there in EX/MEM pipeline.

1) If rs1 in ID/EX pipeline is equal to rd of EX/MEM pipeline, with write back in EX/MEM, and registers not being zero, then alu_result in EX/MEM is passed as operand A.
2) If the above condition is not satisfied and if rs1 in ID/EX is equal to rd of MEM/WB pipeline, with registers not being zero and write back is on. <br/>
   a) If write back signals in MEM/WB is indicating that the instruction in it was load then register value corresponding to the value read from data cache is passed.<br/>
   b) If not then alu_result from MEM/WB is passed.
3) If all the above conditions are not met then read_data1 from ID/EX is passed as operand A to ALU.

For operand B, the similar conditions are checked as above but additionally making sure that immediate is passed whenever instruction ID/EX is not R-type. As the conditions for passing B is complicated than A that can be verified from the Verilog code.

### Control signals (control unit):

|S.No|Signal|Role of the signal|
|--|--|--|
|1| Register write | If register write signal is 1 the data will be written in the register file. Otherwise data is not written in the register file.|
|2| Mem_to_register | If mem_to_register signal is 1 the data read from the data cache (ld) will be write data value for register file. Otherwise alu_result will be the write data value for register file. |
|3|Mem_read|If mem_read signal is 1, data value is read from the data cache using the address otherwise the data is not read from the data cache.|
|4|Mem_write|If mem_write signal is 1, data value is written in the data cache else the data is not written in the data cache.|
|5|PC_source| PC_source will be 1 when the instruction is branch instruction to select PC + 2 X imm Otherwise PC + 4 will be the updated program counter.|
|6|ALU_source| This is execution signal, this depends on opcode and funct7 values.If instruction is R, based on funct7 value the type of operation like add, sub or mul is determined. And the operands will be data from rs1 and rs2.For other instructions like I format like addi, ld and S-type like sd only addition is needed to performed in execution stage, the addition involves immediate. One of the operands will be immediate.|


## Descirption of verilog code of data path
In the data path, the 4 pipeline registers are named as:
1)	reg [95:0]Pipeline_IF_ID
2)	reg [289:0]pipeline_ID_EX 
3)	 reg [202:0]pipeline_EX_MEM
4)	reg [134:0]pipeline_MEM_WB

•	The instruction cache is of 20 32-bit register (instruction_memory) <br/>
•	The data cache is of 20 64-bit registers. (data_memory)<br/>
•	The register file is of 32 64-bit registers. (register_file)<br/>
•	A and B are operands which are to be passed to ALU. B1 is complement of B <br/>
•	The carry look ahead logic is used to add and subtract two 64-bit numbers which is efficient in time when compared to ripple carry adder.<br/>
•	Booth’s algorithm is used to multiply two operands.<br/>
•	PC stands for program counter. Next PC value depends on the PC_source. With a help of 2:1 MUX and PC_source as select line and PC + 4 and PC + 2 X imm as data lines. <br/>
•	data_written_in_regfile indicates data which is written in register file in the timing diagram.<br/>
•	data_written_in_data_mem indicates the data written in the data cache.<br/>
•	Data_written_in_ins_mem indicates the instruction written in instruction cache.<br/>
•	When instruction_memory_cycle is ON instruction are written in instruction cache.<br/>
•	When data_memory_cycle is ON data is written in data cache at a particular data location.<br/>
•	data_memory_cycle and instruction_memory_cycle signals are used initially to write some instruction in instruction cache and to write some data values in data cache.<br/>

## Writing test bench
	The test bench involves all operation done by the ALU, i.e addition, multiplication and subtraction.<br/>
	The test bench is written to cover instructions add, addi, sub, mul, ld, sd.<br/>
	Full forwarding is done so that correct values are written and correct values are read<br/>

Initially 12 instructions are written in ins-cache including two stalls. Data values 45, 20, -20 are written at the locations 0, 1, 2 of data cache. <br/>
After writing the instructions in the instruction cache and data values in data cache the scenario is: <br/>
Instruction Cache: <br/>
![Picture1](https://github.com/112101011/5-stage-RISC-V-pipeline./assets/111628378/35b7198a-5ca6-45ce-abf3-a2b1a5201259) <br/>
Data-cache: <br/>
![Picture2](https://github.com/112101011/5-stage-RISC-V-pipeline./assets/111628378/9f76abe9-ceb7-4125-b0c6-2356166933a8) <br/>

We can observe that in total 5 clock cycles are taken to completely run a instruction, ld – the critical instruction requires all the 5-stages completely. <br/>
The forwarding lines are indicated in red. As there is full forwarding there is no requirement of STALLs in first 6 instructions. In the below picture instructions and its computation is shown along with full forwarding:
![pic 13](https://github.com/112101011/5-stage-RISC-V-pipeline./assets/111628378/44b65d70-a9f3-4711-8de7-29edd18201b5) <br/>

Including 2 stalls and 10 instructions on total we can say that 12 instructions are executed. Here stalls are implemented by add x0, x0, x0. <br/>
Total Number of cycles for this 10 instructions(2-stalls) = 16 <br/>
Actual Number of instructions = 10 <br/>
Stalls = 2 <br/>
[average CPI]: CPI = (16) / (10) = 1.6 (2-stalls are not considered as instructions) <br/>
The CPI is not 1(ideal) because some time  is required to get full pipelining. <br/>


## Timing diagram:
![pic19](https://github.com/112101011/5-stage-RISC-V-pipeline./assets/111628378/388b7eb7-e92c-45b0-a33a-7ac61d258f18) <br/>
The register  values in each cycle can be observed from the above timing diagram. pipeline_IF_ID, pipeline_ID_EX, pipeline_EX_MEM, pipeline_MEM_WB, represents the pipeline register values. data_written_in_regfile represents the data written back in the register file. data_written_in_data_mem represents the data written in the data cache. data_written_in_ins_mem represents the data written in the ins cache. <br/>

Maximum Power Consumption is 83.762W.

## Further scope
1) Adding additional hardware at ID stage for branch instructions to reduce the number of stalls for control Hazards (or) maintaining a branch predictor static or dynamic branch predictor.
2) Increasing the number of stages so that on an average for many instructions the average performance can be increased significantly.
